# Functional Koans - Functional Javascript #

Based on EdgeCase's fantastic [Ruby koans](http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans),
the goal of the Functional Javascript koans is to teach you Functional Javascript through testing.

When you first run the koans, you'll be presented with a runtime error and a
stack trace indicating where the error occured. Your goal is to make the
error go away. As you fix each error, you should learn something about
the Javascript language and functional programming in general.

Your journey towards Javascript enlightenment starts in the AboutAsserts.js file. These
koans will be very simple, so don't overthink them! As you progress through
more koans, more and more Javascript syntax will be introduced which will allow
you to solve more complicated problems and use more advanced techniques.


### Getting Started

The Functional Javascript koans use the Functional Javascript library from http://osteele.com/sources/javascript/functional/ .This library is included; but see the Url for documentation.
