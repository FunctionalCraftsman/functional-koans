# Functional koans

### Getting started

Install a recent version of ghc or preferably the Haskell Platform.

### Running the koans

To run the koans, run one of these commands in src/koans.
(If you installed plan9port, use mk instead of make.)

make fun

make hofun

If a file does not compile, either you did not replace __ with a value,
or the type of the value you added does not strictly match the type
expected by the Haskell compiler.
