# Functional Koans - Functional Javascript #

Based on EdgeCase's fantastic [Ruby koans](http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans),
the goal of the Functional Javascript koans is to teach you Functional Javascript through testing.

When you first run the koans, you'll be presented with a runtime error and a
stack trace indicating where the error occured. Your goal is to make the
error go away. As you fix each error, you should learn something about
the Javascript language and functional programming in general.

Your journey towards Javascript enlightenment starts in the AboutAsserts.js file. These
koans will be very simple, so don't overthink them! As you progress through
more koans, more and more Javascript syntax will be introduced which will allow
you to solve more complicated problems and use more advanced techniques.


### Getting Started

These Koans are written to be run using the JsTestDriver unit test framework 
which runs Javascript from within Eclipse concurrently in multiple attached browsers.

To use you will need Eclipse 3.6 for Javascript Web Developers - http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-javascript-web-developers/heliosm4
along with the JsTestDriver plugin - http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/wiki/UsingTheEclipsePlugin

### Running the Koans

Import the project into Eclipse 3.6 (with JsTestDriver plugin), start the JsTestDriver, attach a browser,
create a new Js Test Driver run configuration, and Run.

Start editing src-test/AboutAssert.js, and rerunning the tests until they go green.
