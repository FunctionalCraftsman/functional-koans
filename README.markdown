# Functional Koans - Functional Javascript #

Based on EdgeCase's fantastic [Ruby koans](http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans),
the goal of the Functional Javascript koans is to teach you Functional Javascript through testing.

When you first run the koans, you'll be presented with a runtime error and a
stack trace indicating where the error occured. Your goal is to make the
error go away. As you fix each error, you should learn something about
the Javascript language and functional programming in general.

Your journey towards Javascript enlightenment starts in the koans/AboutExpects.js file. These
koans will be very simple, so don't overthink them! As you progress through
more koans, more and more Javascript syntax will be introduced which will allow
you to solve more complicated problems and use more advanced techniques.

### Getting Started

* Fork, checkout and then open KoansRunner.html in your browser.
* Read the wisdom; and open the first koans/*.js that needs completion.  The stacktrace should give you a clue.
* Complete the koan, then re-fresh the KoansRunner.html.  Your enlightenment should have increased - you are ready for the next koan!
