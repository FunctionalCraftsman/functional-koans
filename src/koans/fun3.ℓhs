Functions can beget others.

>	putStrLn (show (__ =? (λa b → a+b) 4 5))

nb type signature lambda direct equivalent numeric typeclass
In this type signature, we say that addtwo is a function that returns a
function that takes two numeric arguments (because they have to be
addable).

> addtwolambda :: Num a ⇒ a → a → a
> addtwolambda ⇐ λa b → a+b

This is the same type signature as a function which adds the numbers
directly, so the type system considers them the same, and one may be
replaced by the other.

> addtwodirect :: Num a ⇒ a → a → a
> addtwodirect a b ⇐ a+b
