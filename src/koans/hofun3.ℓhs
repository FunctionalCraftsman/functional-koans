A filter can be strong, or very weak, or somewhere in between.

strong

> 	putStrLn (show ([__] =? filter (λx → False) [1,2,3]))
> 	putStrLn (show ([__] =? (λxs → [x | x←xs, False]) [1,2,3]))
> 	putStrLn (show ([__] =? (λxs → [x | x←xs, x=?1, x=?2, x=?3]) [1,2,3]))

weak

> 	putStrLn (show (["anything","goes","here"] =? (λxs → [x | x←xs, x=?"anything" __ x=?"goes" __ x=?"here"]) ["anything","goes","here"]))
> 	putStrLn (show (["anything","goes","here"] =? (λxs → [x | x←xs, __]) ["anything","goes","here"]))

moderate

> 	putStrLn (show ([1,3] =? filter __ [1,2,3]))
